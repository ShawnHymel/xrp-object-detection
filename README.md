# Performing Object Detection on the XRP

The [XRP](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/sparkfun-electronics/KIT-22296/19117674) is a fantastic platform for helping students and hobbyists dive into the world of robotics. While the starter sensors are great for beginners, this project aims to add something more advanced to the platform: object detection.

Object detection is an advanced computer vision concept that involves attempting to identify and locate instances of objects in an image. By adding object detection to the XRP, we can use it to manipulate objects using vision only!

## Getting Started

Please see this [full tutorial](https://www.digikey.com/en/maker/projects/adding-object-detection-vision-to-the-xrp-robot/9119cd68087145bca1470a0ed13d1d9a) for instructions on creating this project.

Note that you will need a 3D printer, a Google Coral Dev Board Micro, extra cables, and access to a Linux computer for this project.

Instructions and source code for training and deploying a custom object detection model to the Coral Micro can be found [here](https://github.com/ShawnHymel/google-coral-micro-object-detection).
